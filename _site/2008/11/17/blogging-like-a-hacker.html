<h1>Blogging Like a Hacker</h1>
<p class="meta">17 Nov 2008 &#8211; San Francisco</p>
<p>Back in 2000, when I thought I was going to be a professional writer, I spent hours a day on LiveJournal doing writing practice with other aspiring poets and authors. Since then I&#8217;ve blogged at three different domains about web standards, print design, photography, Flash, illustration, information architecture, ColdFusion, package management, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, advertising, Ruby, Rails, and Erlang.</p>
<p>I love writing. I get a kick out of sharing my thoughts with others. The act of transforming ideas into words is an amazingly efficient way to solidify and refine your thoughts about a given topic. But as much as I enjoy blogging, I seem to be stuck in a cycle of quitting and starting over. Before starting the current iteration, I resolved to do some introspection to determine the factors that were leading to this destructive pattern.</p>
<p>I already knew a lot about what I <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> want. I was tired of complicated blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly lag behind the latest software release. Something like Posterous looked attractive, but I wanted to style my blog, and it needed to be hosted at the domain of my choosing. For the same reason, other hosted sites (wordpress.com, blogger.com) were disqualified. There are a few people directly using GitHub as a blog (which is very cool), but that&#8217;s a bit too much of an impedance mismatch for my tastes.</p>
<p>On Sunday, October 19th, I sat down in my San Francisco apartment with a glass of apple cider and a clear mind. After a period of reflection, I had an idea. While I&#8217;m not specifically trained as an author of prose, I <strong>am</strong> trained as an author of code. What would happen if I approached blogging from a software development perspective? What would that look like?</p>
<p>First, all my writing would be stored in a Git repository. This would ensure that I could try out different ideas and explore a variety of posts all from the comfort of my preferred editor and the command line. I&#8217;d be able to publish a post via a simple deploy script or post-commit hook. Complexity would be kept to an absolute minimum, so a static site would be preferable to a dynamic site that required ongoing maintenance. My blog would need to be easily customizable; coming from a graphic design background means I&#8217;ll always be tweaking the site&#8217;s appearance and layout.</p>
<p>Over the last month I&#8217;ve brought these concepts to fruition and I&#8217;m pleased to announce <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. If you&#8217;re reading this on the website (http://tom.preston-werner.com), you&#8217;re seeing a Jekyll generated blog!</p>
<p>To understand how this all works, open up my <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw"><span class="caps">TPW</span></a> repo in a new browser window. I&#8217;ll be referencing the code there.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/index.html">index.html</a>. This file represents the homepage of the site. At the top of the file is a chunk of <span class="caps">YAML</span> that contains metadata about the file. This data tells Jekyll what layout to give the file, what the page&#8217;s title should be, etc. In this case, I specify that the &#8220;default&#8221; template should be used. You can find the layout files in the <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts">_layouts</a> directory. If you open <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_layouts/default.html">default.html</a> you can see that the homepage is constructed by wrapping index.html with this layout.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice Liquid templating code in these files. <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> is a simple, extensible templating language that makes it easy to embed data in your templates. For my homepage I wanted to have a list of all my blog posts. Jekyll hands me a Hash containing various data about my site. A reverse chronological list of all my blog posts can be found in <code>site.posts</code>. Each post, in turn, contains various fields such as <code>title</code> and <code>date</code>.</p>
<p>Jekyll gets the list of blog posts by parsing the files in the <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts">_posts</a> directory. Each post&#8217;s filename contains the publishing date and slug (what shows up in the <span class="caps">URL</span>) that the final <span class="caps">HTML</span> file should have. Open up the file corresponding to this blog post: <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile">2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile</a>. GitHub renders textile files by default, so to better understand the file, click on the <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/tpw/tree/master/_posts/2008-11-17-blogging-like-a-hacker.textile?raw=true">raw</a> view to see the original file. Here I&#8217;ve specified the <code>post</code> layout. If you look at that file you&#8217;ll see an example of a nested layout. Layouts can contain other layouts allowing you a great deal of flexibility in how pages are assembled. In my case I use a nested layout in order to show related posts for each blog entry. The <span class="caps">YAML</span> also specifies the post&#8217;s title which is then embedded in the post&#8217;s body via Liquid.</p>
<p>Posts are handled in a special way by Jekyll. The date you specify in the filename is used to construct the <span class="caps">URL</span> in the generated site. This post, for instance, ends up at <code>http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html</code>.</p>
<p>Files that do not reside in directories prefixed with an underscore are mirrored into a corresponding directory structure in the generated site. If a file does not have a <span class="caps">YAML</span> preface, it is not run through the Liquid interpreter. Binary files are copied over unmodified.</p>
<p>In order to convert your raw site into the finished version, you simply run:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>$ jekyll /path/to/raw/site /path/to/place/generated/site</code></pre>
<p>Jekyll is still a very young project. I&#8217;ve only developed the exact functionality that I&#8217;ve needed. As time goes on I&#8217;d like to see the project mature and support additional features. If you end up using Jekyll for your own blog, drop me a line and let me know what you&#8217;d like to see in future versions. Better yet, fork the project over at GitHub and hack in the features yourself!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been living with Jekyll for just over a month now. I love it. Driving the development of Jekyll based on the needs of my blog has been very rewarding. I can edit my posts in TextMate, giving me automatic and competent spell checking. I have immediate and first class access to the <span class="caps">CSS</span> and page templates. Everything is backed up on GitHub. I feel a lightness now when I&#8217;m writing a post. The system is simple enough that I can keep the entire conversion process in my head. The distance from my brain to my blog has shrunk, and, in the end, I think that will make me a better author.</p>
